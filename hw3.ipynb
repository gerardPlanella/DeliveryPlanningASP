    "## 2. The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, you will write an ASP program to solve the\n",
    "following (toy) planning problem.\n",
    "This problem is about finding a way to deliver some packages from warehouses\n",
    "to specified delivery locations, using several (electric) trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem works in time steps. At each time step, each truck can perform exactly\n",
    "one action—move to an adjacent node, wait, (un)load a package, and so on (more details below).\n",
    "The problem operates on a map that consists of a graph with nodes and edges.\n",
    "All nodes and edges are single capacity, meaning that only a single truck can be on a node or travel on an edge at each time step.\n",
    "The task is to find a plan (a sequence of actions, one per truck per time step)\n",
    "after which the goal state is achieved: all packages are delivered, the trucks are empty (i.e., without packages) and are located on a charging spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state of the world consists of:\n",
    "- a road network in the form of an undirected graph;\n",
    "- the location (on the network) and initial load (number of available packages) of one or more warehouses;\n",
    "- the location (on the network) and initial demand (number of packages to be delivered) of one or more delivery locations;\n",
    "- the location (on the network) of one or more charging points; and\n",
    "- the initial location, the initial load (how many packages aboard), the maximum load capacity, the initial battery level, and the maximum battery level of one or more trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "(These are all given as part of the input.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The actions (and their conditions and effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, each truck performs exactly one of the following actions:\n",
    "- It can **wait**—the truck stays in the current location, the battery level stays the same.\n",
    "- It can **move** to an adjacent node—the battery level goes down by 1 unit.\n",
    "- If it is at a warehouse, the warehouse is not empty, and the truck still has capacity, it can **load** one single package from the warehouse into the truck—the battery level stays the same.\n",
    "- If it is at a delivery location that still needs some packages, and the truck has at least one package, it can **unload** one single package at the delivery location—the battery level stays the same.\n",
    "- If it is at a charging station, and the battery is not at full capacity, it can **charge**—the battery level increases by 1 unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following additional restrictions have to be taken into account:\n",
    "- If the battery level of a truck is 0, it cannot move to another node.\n",
    "- At each location, there can be at most one truck at the same time.\n",
    "- Trucks cannot pass each other on a piece of road—e.g., trucks at adjacent locations cannot swap places in a single time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to achieve a state that has all of the following properties:\n",
    "- All required deliveries must have been performed.\n",
    "- Each truck has no packages aboard.\n",
    "- Each truck is located at a charging station.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish this notebook by encoding this problem into ASP.\n",
    "Make sure that your encoding works for any given input (that is of the right format).\n",
    "That is, for each input, your code constructs an answer set program\n",
    "whose answer sets correspond to the (shortest) sequences\n",
    "of actions that achieve the goal from the initial state of the world—if the goal state can be reached within a given maximum number of steps."
